   **   ~~~   ** ... Possible reasons for low outlet air dry-bulb temperatures are: This DX coil
   **   ~~~   **    1) may have a low inlet air dry-bulb temperature. Inlet air temperature = 20.769 C.
   **   ~~~   **    2) may have a low air flow rate per watt of cooling capacity. Check inputs.
   **   ~~~   **    3) is used as part of a HX assisted cooling coil which uses a high sensible effectiveness. Check inputs.
   ** Warning ** CalcDoe2DXCoil: Coil:Cooling:DX:SingleSpeed="MAIN COOLING COIL 1" - Air volume flow rate per watt of rated total cooling capacity is out of range at 2.427E-005 m3/s/W.
